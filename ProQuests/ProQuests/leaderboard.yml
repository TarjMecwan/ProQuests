# 
# Leaderboard File
# 
# This is the leaderboard file where all leaderboard data will be saved and stored. You can
# edit all of the settings pertaining to the leaderboards here such as the total amount
# or leaders to track and the format how to display them.
# 
# ======================================================
# 
# Settings:
# 
# The amount of players to track in the leaderboard
# total: 10
# 
# The delay in seconds between updates of the leaderboard
# update_delay: 600
# 
# Whether or not you want the monthly stats to automatically reset
# reset_on_month: true
# 
# Whether or not you want to use the menu or chat based leaderboard display
# use_menu: true
# 
# ======================================================
# 
# Menu Example:
# 
# menu:
#   size: 27
#   name: '&8Quest Leaders'
#   leader_slots:
#   - 11
#   - 12
#   - 13
#   - 14
#   - 15
#   valid_name: '&a%position%. &7%player%'
#   valid_lore:
#   - '&bMonthly Points: &7%monthly_points%
#   - '&bTotal Points: &7%total_points%
#   - '&bQuests Completed: &7%total_completed_quests%
#   invalid_name: '&cUnavailable'
#   invalid_lore:
#   - '&7You could be here!
# 
#   ** This leaderboard menu system is very simliar to the **
#   ** quest menu system especially with the placeholder items **
# 
# ======================================================
# 
# Leaders Section:
# 
# The leaders section is a way for the plugin to cache the top users without
# actually having to cache the player data. This is only used for users who have MySQL
# enabled. What this does is store the top players UUID's so that on a server restart
# it won't have to wait for the players to join to update their data, so the top
# players will always be listed.
# 
# ======================================================
# 
# Placeholders:
# There are a bunch of placeholders built into the plugin that can be used in messages or
# item names, lore etc. These can all be found on the plugin/wiki page.
